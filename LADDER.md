Below is a ready-to-paste **`ladder.md`**–style documentation tailored to your SIH project (AI-Powered FRA Atlas & DSS). It follows the same stage-wise roadmap in your uploaded `ladder.md` and the content/requirements from your attached PPT. Drop this into your website repo (Replit/Lovable/etc.) as `ladder.md` — it’s formatted for copy-paste and for judges, developers and deployers to read.

I referenced your uploaded slide deck and the original ladder template for alignment. &#x20;

# Ladder / Development Roadmap — AI-Powered FRA Atlas & DSS

**Project:** AI-Powered FRA Atlas & WebGIS DSS
**Problem ID:** 25108 (SIH 2025)
**Short:** Digitize FRA legacy records → AI asset mapping → FRA Atlas (WebGIS) → DSS for scheme convergence.&#x20;

---

## 1. Ideation → Static Showcase

**Goal:** Clear concept, visuals & single-page landing that explains problem, impact and solution.

**Deliverable**

* One-page site / landing with hero, mission, 2-line problem, top 5 features, one CTA (“Explore Demo”).
* Graphics: project logo, simplified flow image (Scan → AI → Map → DSS).&#x20;

**Stack**

* HTML, Tailwind CSS, minimal JS (Alpine.js).
* Content stored as JSON for easy edits.

**Checklist**

* Crisp title, short tagline, link to slide deck, team contact.
* Mobile responsive, accessible contrast.

---

## 2. PoC → Dynamic Static Site

**Goal:** Demonstrate small data-driven flow and interactivity.

**Deliverable**

* Multi-page static site: About, Solution, Tech, Team, Contact, Mini Demo page.
* Demo: upload 5 sample scanned pattas → show OCR excerpt + mapped polygon overlay image (preprocessed sample).

**Stack**

* Static React (Vite) or Next.js static export.
* LocalStorage for demo persistence.
* Host: GitHub Pages / Replit public deploy.

**QA / Minimizing Bugs**

* Validate uploaded files (size/type).
* Fallback for OCR errors: show original image + extracted text side-by-side.

---

## 3. Prototype → Starter Kit with Auth & CRUD

**Goal:** Basic app with authentication and editable records for 1 district.

**Deliverable**

* Login (role: admin, district officer, viewer).
* Upload/Manage claims (CRUD).
* Map viewer with uploaded shapefiles / GeoJSON layers.
* Simple rule-based DSS demo: choose patta → show recommended scheme(s).

**Stack**

* Frontend: React + Leaflet/Mapbox.
* Backend: Flask or FastAPI.
* DB: SQLite (prototype) or PostgreSQL (if possible).
* Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend).

**Dev Notes**

* Use JWT + role checks.
* Provide CSV/GeoJSON import + sample template.

---

## 4. MVP → Functional Web App

**Goal:** Real, usable demo supporting multiple villages, basic AI inference pipeline and WebGIS.

**Deliverable**

* OCR+NER pipeline integrated (server endpoint).
* Asset mapping (pretrained CV models) applied to one Sentinel tile — returns ponds/farms/forest polygons.
* PostGIS-backed API for spatial queries.
* DSS: rule engine + ML scorer (explainable outputs).
* Dashboard: progress KPIs, filter by state/district/village.
* Download: GeoJSON / PDF report export.

**Stack**

* Frontend: React, Zustand for state, Mapbox GL JS.
* Backend: FastAPI with Pydantic models, Celery (task queue).
* DB: PostgreSQL + PostGIS.
* ML: PyTorch/TensorFlow serving (TorchServe / TF-Serving) or model REST endpoints.
* Storage: S3 / bucket / local for demo.
* Hosting: Vercel/Netlify + Railway/Render; use GEE for heavy RS processing prototypes.

**Testing & Reliability**

* Unit tests (Pytest), frontend tests (Jest/RTL).
* Use type checking (mypy / TypeScript).
* Linting + pre-commit hooks.
* Provide a "confidence" score on AI outputs and require human verification > threshold.

## 5. Aalpha → Developer Framework (Contributor-ready)

**Goal:** Production-grade developer experience: strong typing, validation, docs, tests.

**Deliverable**

* Monorepo (frontend/backend) with examples and seed data.
* API docs (OpenAPI) and local dev seeds.
* Validation: Zod (frontend) + Pydantic (backend).
* Tests: unit + integration + CI on push.

**Stack**

* Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript).
* Backend: FastAPI (Pydantic).
* Tests: Jest (frontend), Pytest (backend).
* Docs: Swagger UI + README stepwise instructions.

**Developer UX**

* Seed DB loader (sample claims + assets).
* Dev scripts: `npm run dev`, `make start`, `./scripts/seed_db.sh`.

---

## 6. Beta → Automated & Containerized

**Goal:** Dockerized app, CI/CD, automated deployments.

**Deliverable**

* Docker Compose for local multi-service dev (web, api, db, worker).
* GitHub Actions pipeline: lint → test → build → deploy staging.
* Health checks & metrics endpoints (basic Prometheus / status).
* Backup & restore scripts for PostGIS.

**Best Practices to Reduce Bugs**

* Immutable images, pinned versions.
* DB migrations (Alembic).
* Secrets via environment (Vault/Secrets Manager in cloud).
* Staging environment mirrors prod.

---

## 7. Product → Scalable SaaS (Production)

**Goal:** Scalable, secure, multi-state roll-out with monitoring & governance.

**Deliverable**

* K8s deployment, autoscaling, HTTPS, RBAC.
* Multi-tenant design (per-state isolation if required).
* Logging, alerting, observability dashboards.
* Data governance module (consent, restricted layers for sacred groves).
* API marketplace & integration docs for MGNERGA/JJM/DAJGUA.

**Stack**

* Kubernetes, Helm charts.
* Managed DB (RDS/Aurora / Cloud SQL) with PostGIS.
* Model serving: scalable endpoints (KFServing / SageMaker).
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD.

# Feature Checklist (core from PPT)

* OCR & NER for legacy documents (LayoutLM/TrOCR approach).
* Georeferencing tool & manual editor for corrections.
* Asset mapping: semantic segmentation for NDVI/NDWI → ponds/farms/forest patches.
* WebGIS Atlas: IFR/CR/CFR layers, filters, time slider.
* DSS: rule engine + explainable ML prioritizer.
* Exports: GeoJSON, Shapefile, PDF reports.
* Mobile-ready feedback for patta holders (offline support).&#x20;

# Minimal Bugs & Hardening Checklist (practical)

1. **Input validation everywhere** (files, shapes, coordinates).
2. **Confidence thresholds**: don't auto-apply low-confidence georefs — flag for review.
3. **Human-in-the-loop** UI for final approvals (reduces risky automated changes).
4. **Retry & idempotency** for async tasks (OCR, RS jobs).
5. **Schema migrations & backups** scheduled.
6. **Access control & audit logs** for edits — maintain provenance.
7. **Unit + integration tests** on all critical flows (OCR → NER → Geo → DSS).
8. **Small batch sizes** for model inference during demos to avoid OOMs.

---

# Data & Privacy (must-have)

* Hash or salt any personal identifiers stored (Aadhaar not stored raw).
* Consent UI & record for community data entry; opt-out option for sensitive layers.
* Role-based data visibility (public vs restricted).
* Audit logs for every edit/approval.

---

# Deployment Quick Guide (for Replit / Lovable / Repos)

**Prototype on Replit / Lovable**

* Provide frontend static in `public/` or Vite build.
* Backend: FastAPI with a single API endpoint for OCR demo (use small model or mocked response).
* DB: SQLite for demo mode (no PostGIS) — store GeoJSON as text for demo.
* Add `README.md` steps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

**Staging / Production**

* Use Docker: `docker compose up --build`.
* For PostGIS: use `postgis/postgis:13-3.1` image.
* CI: run `pytest` and `npm test` before merges.

# Demo Data & How Judges Can Test (recommended)

* 20 scanned pattas (sample) with a few hand-drawn sketch maps.
* 1 Sentinel-2 tile + one high-res sample showing farms, pond.
* Expected demo flows: upload scan → automated extraction (OCR+NER) → show polygon & AI asset overlay → DSS recommendation card → export GeoJSON.

---

# Suggested API Summary (for integrators)

* `POST /api/upload/scan` — accepts scan → returns `doc_id`, `ocr_text`, `entities` (confidence).
* `GET /api/claim/{id}` — claim metadata + linked polygons.
* `POST /api/asset/map/run` — trigger asset mapping job (returns job\_id; poll `/job/{id}`).
* `GET /api/dss/recommendations?village_id=xxx` — returns prioritized interventions + rationale (SHAP-like summary).
* `GET /api/export?format=geojson&village=xxx` — download.

---

# Pilot / Next Steps (recommended)

1. Pilot one district in each ecosystem: (MP — central forests), Odisha — coastal/forest, Telangana — plateau, Tripura — northeast.
2. Partner with 1 local NGO per state for ground truth.
3. Seek sample data access from state tribal cells for 100 scanned pattas.

If you want, I can:

* Convert this into a **`README.md` + `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `DEPLOY.md`** set for your repo.
* Or generate a **starter Next.js + FastAPI repo scaffold** (with sample seed data and minimal OCR mock) you can deploy on Replit/Vercel immediately — tell me which option you prefer and I’ll produce the code scaffold next.
